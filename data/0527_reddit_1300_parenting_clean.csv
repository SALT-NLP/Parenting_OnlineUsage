However, the past month I have had an issue with my right breast. This breast is the one who produces much less milk. It started off as just a cracking/bleeding issue, which I though lanolin was helping, but as time has progressed, I now have a large circle around my nipple that is completely pink, along with little red spots on the outside. The cracking/bleeding still happens every few days, and I've tried adjusting the suction on my pump to help, but I can't get it to fully heal.

"Hi ladies! I've just started EP as of four weeks ago and have been making the best out of a bad situation. Unfortunately our little guy came three weeks early and was having a difficult time latching. We met with numerous lactation consultants, tried a nipple shield, etc but the frustration trying to breastfeed him outweighed the benefits. So with that being said, I have a question I'm hoping someone on here can answer for me! \n\nSince EP, I've noticed my nipples and areola becoming very sore after pumping. This happens even after pumping on the lowest setting possible for 25-30 minutes. I've started using ""Boob-Ease"" pumping lubrication to help with friction and even changed the flange size for my Medela pump. Is this normal?

From the hospital we came back with him then the weight was around 3.2 kg. Then the first month passed and he was up +1kg (~4.2 kg). Now more than a month passed and he's only ~4.6 kg.\nThe eating habits didn't change much, every 2-3 hours he's eating well. And after the meal he's in a good mood, so we're presuming that he's full. I even tracked how much he ate, so that turned out to be around 70-80 g. \n\nNow my question, how far are the ""normal"" boundaries? After all, the first few months should be when the baby gains the highest percentage relative to his weight.\n\nThanks! \n\np.s.

"Hi there. \n\nMy 6 month old wakes a billion times at night. I am bedsharing with her so I can get more rest but ideally I'd have her sleep on her own mattress (which is next to mine on the floor). \n\nI feed her to sleep for every nap and at night.

I don't know how long a 6 month old can comfortably go between feeds, or how this will change as she gets older. Also, if I space her feeds out does that mean I should stop feeding her to sleep?

I contacted my father about his birth parents and his lips are sealed tight.

I have to go out of town without my 15 month old. I don't have a choice. This will be our first time apart. I'm a Stay at home mom. He won't take bottles at all but will take a sippy cup with milk.

My daughter is almost 17 months I realize this is early to potty train. We got her a potty chair a couple months ago she started sitting on it with clothes on and about two weeks ago we started sitting her in it between diaper changes. She's gone in the potty a few times and we cheer her on and show its a good thing. With her showing interest and using it sometimes when should I actually attempt to let her go without diapers all together?  I have a little experience as I did help train my two-year-old stepdaughter but her mother did make that kind of complicated since you kept her in diapers often my stepdaughter is now four years old and will usually go to the potty but it does still have accidents during the day,1,potty training

However, it doesn't seem to be waterproof. I've tried it a few times with an absorbent fitted diaper underneath, and every time there have been leaks after ~two hours. The cover itself doesn't feel particularly damp, but if LO has any clothes on over the cover, they get damp. \n\nIs there something I'm doing wrong here? Should I try felting the diaper?

All our ancestors did it\uff0cwhich to me is the most natural way of growing up. So it comes to several questions. Do I need to follow the idea of this article to avoid sunlight and give my baby some Vitamin D supplement drops instead?

"Hi all,\n\nMy daughter will be 5 months old on Saturday. I took her for her 4 month checkup on 1/11 and she weighed 11 lbs, 2 oz, and was in the 4th percentile for weight. I can't remember what she weighed at her prior appointments but at her 6 week appointment she was in the 18th percentile. We took her in last week (2/8) and she weighed 11 lbs, 8 oz, and was in the 2nd percentile. She goes to daycare 3-4 days a week and at daycare eats 18-20 oz of breast milk. While not at daycare she breastfeeds every 2-3 hours but sleeps most the night usually feeding once overnight. Everything else seems normal, she almost never spits up and her BMs are regular.

I\u2019ve had my nexplanon implant since July 2016 and after the irregular periods passed I didn\u2019t experience any other side effects until now. I\u2019m having some breast tenderness which is fairly painful to the touch other than that I don\u2019t notice it. In addition to my implant my SO and I also use the pull out method so I\u2019m highly doubtful of a pregnancy. I no longer have periods due to the progesterone in the implant. Im just wondering if anybody else has experienced this kind of delay of side effects while using this birth control method.\nThanks!,0,

My period almost stopped about a month into my pack. I was on it all of 2017 and stopped in December. but I recently went through my Clue app logs (this app is great Btw) and noticed that in 2015-2016, my periods were literally only two weeks apart most of the time and that to me seems way too soon in between. \nSo I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s how my cycle was before, once it returns after being off the pill for a month now, am I gonna expect this every two weeks again? \U0001f62c anyone else gone through this?

After reading all of ASOUE again, and 'The Little Prince' by Antonie De Saint-Exupery I have been stunned by how brilliant they are. In such simple writing and simple stories, writers manage to summarise huge lifetime themes and ideas in a way which is so accessible, so perfectly written.\n\nChildren's books are beautiful - they draw you right back to moralistic basics and enable a better foundation for the understanding of the moral ambiguities of 'adult literature'; I feel like a lot more people should pay attention to the value of them.\n\nJust my thoughts :)",0,

"A little back story: my son is 20 weeks old. I have trouble producing enough milk for him so he gets 8-12 ounces of formula a day. \n\nA few days ago, one of my friends was generous enough to give me a double medela pump so I can start working on increasing my supply. Problem is, I can't double pump because my right breast refuses to spit any milk out without me practically ripping it off with breast compressions. I know that this side is my bad producer, but it does get engorged and leak, I know it is producing milk. I will pump, I'll feel a letdown but only get drops while I stay full of milk. If I squeeze the crap out of it, I can get between .25-.5 ounce from it. \n\nAny advice on getting that side to react better to a pump so I can work more on increasing my supply?

"If another child has a weapon, such as a rock, and they're trying to hurt your child with it, what do you do? In any case where a child is trying to hurt mine, the most I do *physically* is block by getting in between them and then get my child to safety. But if a child were to have a weapon of some sort, and that child was closer to you than your own, would you physically stop them and how would you do it? In my case last night, a girl had a big rock and tried to hit my 18 month old in the head with it, and as I'm bounding towards them, I boom in the most authoritative voice I could muster, ""put the rock down NOW.""

"My 8wo is incredibly sensitive to dairy, so I've gone off it just recently. Unfortunately I have about 75oz of frozen breast milk that I can't use right now because I pumped it while I was still eating dairy (he vomits and gets terrible reflux from it). So I've started pumping as much as possible for the remainder of my maternity leave (another 4.5 weeks), so I can have a stash stored for when I return to work. I'm going to continue pumping at work but I'm worried it won't be enough to provide for him while he's in childcare, since I hear your milk supply decreases significantly if you don't BF as often. We did try him on a soy based formula in case we need to supplement, but he threw that up as well and was constipated for almost 24 hours.

"Okay, so I am only using a hand pump, my baby is EBF with a bottle here and there so mommy can go on a date with daddy etc. I used up my small freezer stash and am trying build up more. \n\nThe first time I pumped after having not done it in a while I got nearly 3 ounces out of each breast. Now I'm lucky to get 2 out of both combined. I don't even pump up the pressure on the hand pump because then I get nothing. I literally just put the pump on and go because that seems to get the best results. My nipples are super sore and and I'm not pumping anything hardly. \n\nI think my flanges might be too big. It may be part of the issue, but I also don't understand how I can get less milk the more often I pump. And I usually pump late at night/early morning because of the greater production during that time. If I pump in the afternoon or evening I barely get half an ounce out of both even when engorged.\n\nHelp!\n\nEDIT: Spelling. I can do it.",1,breastfeeding

"Hi,\nI'm hoping for some feedback or insight about mid-cycle bleeding that I've been having. I had miscarriage in June that ended up lasting about three months because of retained products (more info. in my post history). I'm now on my fourth cycle since then and they are increasingly becoming more like they used to be. One thing that has been consisently different is spotting around 7-8 dpo, in each cycle. It is super light and lasts a day or two at most. Then it stops and I don't bleed again until my period or do the day before. I know that my cycles might be different or take awhile to regulate given my experience but I still worry about. Does anyone have insight or a similar experience? My ob-gyn doesn't seem concerned at all. I'm worried about low progesterone but since the bleeding stops completely again Im not sure if that makes sense. Any advice is appreciated!
